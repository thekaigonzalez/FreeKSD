# Create your own Command Line interface for Kux Using DSH!
we've all been there, you want to make something but don't know how.

Except, I'm showing you how.

## Step 1: install DSH
Open up bin/shch and follow the questions like so:

```bash
Kux % ./bin/shch


...


bootchooser: Which boot manager would you like to install?

setup/~$ default

bootchooser: Is your bootloader from an external github user (y/n)

setup/~$ n

bootchooser: alright, calibration complete.

bootchooser: copying default bootmgr directories to installer directories...

bootchooser: Files copied! adding installs to registry...
```

Then, Open usr/dsh/.
Don't mess with any of the other directories!

## Step 2: Build the command

Create usr/dsh/<name>.lua

Write this inside of it


```lua

local self = {}

-- command entry point
function self:Main(arguments)
    print("Hello, World!")
end

return self

```

Basically, This creates an object (`self`) that contains the entries for 
our command.

Then, It adds Main function which contains logic for our command.

After, Returns `self` which contains the `Main` function. 

Then, Run the command.

```bash
~ % test

test
```

works!
